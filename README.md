# StudentRegistrationForn

This is a student registration form. It takes the input from the user and stores the data in the database. I have used HTML,CSS in frontend and PHP as a backend.
To implement this project, you must install XAMMP first and then create a database name "form" and a table in the database called "users" with following attrubutes:
1.Name
2.Father_Name
3.Mother_Name
4.DOB
5.Religion
6.Phone
7.Adress1
8.Adress2
9.Country
10.State
11.City
12.PIN
13.PAN
14.Adhaar
15.Passport

To create a database and table, you need to start APACHE from XAMMP and then MySQL. After starting the both, you need to click on the Admin  button of MySQL.It will lead
you to PHP MyAdmin Panel from where you can create database and table.

Also,put both the files of this repo in one folder.That folder must be placed in the htdocs folder. You will find htdocs folder in XAMMP program files. 

After you have followed all of the above steps, go to browser and type: localhost/foldername (The name of the folder that contains the files of this repo).
You will now be able to use this and store the data.
